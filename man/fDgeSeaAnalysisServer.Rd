\title{An analysis module that combines differential expression with GESA.}
\usage{
fDgeSeaAnalysisServer(id, rfds, ..., gdb = NULL, debug = NULL)
}
\description{
This module enables the interactive configuration and execution of
"paired" differential expression and feature set enrichment.
}
\details{
Although the focus of the analysis workflow in this package is based on
singular units of analysis, there are times like this where we almost always
want to perform two anlayses together, differential expression and GSEA
on the same contrast. This shiny-module presents an interface to both.
}
\section{Development Thougts}{

This also gives us the opportunity to exercise different methods of
interaction between independant analysis results. In the DGE and GSEA
scenario, for instance, we might want the linked brushing that happens within
the \code{fdge} volcano to do a "significant gene set search" in the fgsea result.

More specifically, maybe the volcano plot in the \code{dge_view} module should
be able to broadcast the feature brushing in such a way that the "listener"
in the \code{ffsea_vew} module can react to it. Similarly for the \code{ffsea_vew}
module should be able to broadcast the features that are brushed within
it to the \code{dge_vew} volcano and statistics tables ... or not?
