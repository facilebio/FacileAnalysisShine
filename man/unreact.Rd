\title{Replace reactive versions of facile objects with their "inert" counterparts}
\usage{
unreact(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{stuff and things}
}
\value{
a version of x with an "inert" versions of internal facile-components
(primariy FacileDataStore) wherever they may be.
}
\description{
This function is primariy meant to be called within the \code{frunGadget}
framework. We attempt to find all "reactive"-like components and covert them
into their "inert" versions so that they can be used in the context of an
ongoing analysis outside of the shiny world. This is an important function,
but it is purposefully not exported.
}
\details{
We are primariy concerned about replacing the \code{ReactiveFacileDataStore} that
is stashed within facile components (\code{facile_frames}) (set and retrieved with
the \code{set_fds()} and \code{fds()} setters and getters), with their inner
\code{FacileDataStore}

This function needs to be called within the gadget, ie. I'm pretty sure it
needs to fire in a reactive environment, which you get in the
\code{observeEvent(intput$done, { ... })} expression.

NOTE: I don't want to export this function, or its class-speficic
implementation, but when this package is library()/loaded, and one of its
functions calls it inernally, for some reason the \code{unreact.default} function
isn't found ...
}
